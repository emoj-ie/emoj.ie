Last updated: 2026-02-20

## 1) Business Context
- Product: `emoj.ie`, a static-first emoji finder and copy utility with deep browse + detail pages.
- Model: free utility site optimized for user value, retention, and organic growth.
- Primary objective: become the best emoji destination for fast find/copy plus context-rich discovery.
- Priority order: UX > aesthetics > SEO traffic > speed > reliability/tests.

## 2) Target Audience
- People who regularly need emojis in chats, docs, social posts, and product copy.
- Power users who want keyboard-first speed and local memory (recents/favorites).
- SEO visitors looking for emoji meanings, categories, and usage context.

## 3) Core Jobs-To-Be-Done
- "Help me find and copy the right emoji immediately."
- "Help me understand an emoji meaning and alternatives before I use it."
- "Remember what I use most so I don’t repeat search work."

## 4) Product Constraints
- Static-first architecture compatible with GitHub Pages.
- Local-first persistence; no required login/accounts.
- English-only UI for current phase.
- Privacy-friendly analytics allowed.

## 5) Competitive Landscape
- Direct: Emojipedia, GetEmoji, FindEmoji, EmojiTerra.
- Adjacent: OS pickers (macOS Emoji Viewer, Windows Emoji Panel).
- Differentiation target:
  - faster perceived interaction,
  - stronger visual distinctiveness,
  - better relevance + copy ergonomics,
  - cleaner SEO route quality.

## 6) Differentiators To Build
- Ranked relevance with typo tolerance and synonym support.
- Copy-format flexibility (emoji, unicode, html, shortcode) with smart defaults.
- Local favorites + recents with keyboard shortcuts.
- Curated, high-quality detail/context pages for SEO and user confidence.
- Distinctive brutalist-inspired design that remains highly accessible.
- Honest competitor comparison pages for switch-intent SEO (`/alternatives/*`).
- Decision-oriented alternative pages with switch signals + migration guidance.

## 7) Objections And Responses
- Objection: "All emoji sites are the same."
  - Response: visibly different UX, better relevance, faster workflows, richer context.
- Objection: "I only need quick copy."
  - Response: one-click copy remains primary path; advanced features stay optional.
- Objection: "I don’t want tracking."
  - Response: privacy-friendly analytics only; no account required.

## 8) Switching Dynamics (JTBD Four Forces)
- Push: ad-heavy, slow, or cluttered alternatives.
- Pull: faster find/copy flow + better design + local-first persistence.
- Habit: users default to OS pickers or familiar sites.
- Anxiety: concerns about complexity and trustworthiness.

## 9) Customer Language
- Preferred terms:
  - "copy emoji"
  - "emoji meaning"
  - "emoji keyboard"
  - "emoji categories"
  - "emoji symbols"
- Avoid:
  - overly technical jargon in UI labels,
  - inflated marketing language.

## 10) Brand Voice
- Clear, practical, and lightweight.
- Friendly and direct, not chatty.
- Confident without hype.

## 11) Proof And Evidence
- Static-first architecture with small homepage payload.
- Existing generated route depth and sitemap coverage.
- Measurable quality gates in CI: build/tests/links/a11y/smoke/perf budget checks.
- Expanded indexable coverage: category hubs, curated search topics, tag clusters, competitor alternatives.
