# emoj.ie Project Plan

Last updated: 2026-02-20

## Goals
- Make `emoj.ie` the fastest and easiest place to find and copy emojis.
- Improve discovery (search, browse, related content) without adding unnecessary complexity.
- Expand useful, indexable content (emoji detail/category/tag surfaces) while avoiding thin pages.
- Maintain local-first behavior and privacy-respecting defaults.

## Definition Of "Best Emoji Site"
- Speed: near-instant interactions on mobile and desktop.
- UX: minimal friction from search to copy.
- SEO: high-quality, intent-matched indexable pages.
- Delight: polished, accessible, responsive interface.
- Reliability: automated tests for critical user journeys.

## Principles And Constraints
- Keep architecture simple: static-first HTML/CSS/JS + current build scripts.
- Preserve local-first persistence (recents/favorites/settings on-device).
- Keep auto-language behavior and avoid forced account/sign-in flows.
- Favor minimal JS and predictable rendering paths.
- Require docs, tests, and passing quality gates before marking milestones complete.

## Performance Budgets (Initial Draft)
- LCP: <= 1.8s (p75 mobile, good network/device)
- INP: <= 150ms (p75)
- CLS: <= 0.05
- JS budget (critical path): keep app scripts small and defer non-critical work.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Phase 0: Repo discovery, docs scaffolding, clarifying questions, assumptions
- [ ] Phase 1: Competitor research teardown and prioritized backlog
- [ ] Phase 2: Product strategy, messaging, CRO events, microcopy plan
- [ ] Phase 3: UX/UI overhaul + baseline and incremental Playwright coverage
- [ ] Phase 4: Programmatic SEO buildout + routing/meta/sitemap tests
- [ ] Phase 5: Launch and social distribution plan + final regression

## Milestone Checklist (Phase 0)
- [x] Inspect stack/build/test/deploy signals in repository
- [x] Create docs scaffolding in `/docs`
- [ ] Confirm assumptions with stakeholder
- [ ] Get answers to blocking clarifying questions
- [ ] Commit docs scaffolding (`chore: add project docs scaffolding`)

## Decisions
| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-20 | Start with docs-first Phase 0 before feature work | Establishes a shared source of truth and prevents ambiguous implementation. |
| 2026-02-20 | Treat feature implementation as blocked until clarifying questions are answered | Matches explicit operating rules and reduces rework risk. |

## Assumptions (Needs Confirmation)
- A1. Repository is static-first and generated by local Node scripts.
- A2. Existing analytics integration (`Plausible`) is currently allowed.
- A3. Current deployment appears static-hosted with custom domain `emoj.ie`.
- A4. Existing data sources (`openmoji.json`, generated JSON) remain acceptable unless replaced with clear gains.
- A5. We should preserve current “no account required” interaction model by default.

## Open Questions
- See user questionnaire in active task thread (must be resolved before Phase 1+ implementation).
