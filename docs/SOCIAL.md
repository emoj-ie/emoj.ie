# Social Playbook

Last updated: 2026-02-20

## Content Pillars
- Speed workflow demos (search -> copy -> reuse)
- Meaning/discovery education (related emoji and usage context)
- Build quality proof (tests, static-first architecture, route quality)
- Honest comparisons (`/alternatives/*` fit guidance)

## Channel Roles
- X: velocity, launch momentum, short demos
- LinkedIn: product narrative, quality/process credibility
- Reddit: practical feedback and real-world workflow testing

## Hook Library
- `Emoji search is either fast or useful. We rebuilt emoj.ie to be both.`
- `From query to copied emoji in under 10 seconds.`
- `We replaced generic emoji browsing with intent-first routes.`
- `Most emoji tools stop at copy. We added confidence and reuse.`

## X Templates
1. Launch thread
   - Post 1: problem + positioning
   - Post 2: speed workflow clip
   - Post 3: favorites/recents local-first loop
   - Post 4: detail-page meaning + related examples
   - Post 5: alternatives pages with fit guidance
2. Single-post demo
   - `Search by meaning, not exact name. Copy in one click. Save your loop locally.`
   - CTA: `Try it: https://emoj.ie`
3. Quality proof post
   - `Static-first on GitHub Pages, full test gates on every release.`

## LinkedIn Template
- Hook: `We rebuilt emoj.ie to make emoji workflows genuinely faster.`
- Body:
  - `What changed: stronger relevance, local favorites/recents, richer detail pages, and quality SEO route architecture.`
  - `Why it matters: less search friction, faster copy loops, more confidence in usage.`
  - `How we shipped: static-first architecture plus full regression gates.`
- CTA: `Would value feedback from people who use emojis every day: https://emoj.ie`

## Reddit Template
- Title: `I rebuilt an emoji site focused on speed + local-first reuse`
- Body:
  - `No login required; favorites and recents are local-first.`
  - `Added typo-tolerant search, meaning/context pages, and focused category/tag routes.`
  - `Would love blunt feedback on what still feels clunky.`

## 14-Day Cadence
1. Day 1: Launch thread + demo clip
2. Day 2: LinkedIn launch post
3. Day 4: Search quality spotlight (synonyms/typos)
4. Day 6: Favorites + recents workflow clip
5. Day 8: Detail-page context spotlight
6. Day 10: Alternatives page spotlight
7. Day 12: Build quality and test-gate proof
8. Day 14: Lessons learned + next improvements

## Creative Asset Ideas
- 8-12 second vertical clips with cursor + keyboard overlays
- Side-by-side clips: before/after search + copy flow
- Carousel: `Problem -> Workflow -> Result` in 3 slides

## Comment Reply Snippets
- `Useful catch. I can tighten that flow next.`
- `Thanks, can you share the exact query you used?`
- `Fair point. We kept it static-first on purpose for reliability.`
- `That use case is exactly what we want to optimize next.`
